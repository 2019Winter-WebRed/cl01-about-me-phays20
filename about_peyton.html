         <h1> All About Peyton </h1>      
          <hr/>
         <p> Hi! I am a junior in highschool in a family of five including myself. I Have a sister named Keelin who is a senior in highschool and a dog we consider our younger brother named stryder. I  have two wonderful Parents named Andrew and Heather who I love so much. I am orginally from Coastville Downingtown Area in Pa but moved to De three years ago for highschool so my sister and I could run.  I went to catholic grade school all my life until i went to Tatnall. Tatnall was sadly not the school for me but I looked and hoped I could get into Padua and I did the rest is history. I was so excited to meet new people and be back in catholic school all over again, plus I didnt have to figure out what to wear! </p>
             
         <p>  I have made some amazing friends in a few short months and I wouldn't change anything for the world. I have been running since I was in fourth grade and have traveled the country to comepte. I have gone to Kentucky, Indiana, Deleware, Nashville and many more. I love running and getting the chance to travel the country to try toimmerse myslef in different cultures and experience something amazing. I love trying new things such as photography, new hair styles, new foods, new beaches, surfing, skate boarding, and even driving my moms car instaed of the one my sister and I share. </p>
             
         <p> I love spending time with my family and going to the beach in Stone Harbout NJ to jump into the waves and sometimes even surf If I am lucky.<i> My favorite movie to watch is the Princess Diaries.</i> I love going into the harbor and paddle boarding and doing <b>paddle board yoga with my sister</b>. My family and I love sweets and dessert so we always go to the springers creamery, I almost always get cookie dough. I have been on the search for the best buffalo wing and I love eating them. The best place to get them is the 96 street grill in stone harbour NJ.   They are totally spicy but worth it.  I hope after college I can move to Stone Harbour because I love the beach and relaxation along with being happy. </p>
      <blockquote>My favorite quote is "side by side or miles apart sisters will always be connected by the heart". </blockquote>
